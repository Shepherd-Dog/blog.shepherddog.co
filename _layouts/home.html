          Our Strengths
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's hard to boil a company (even a small company like ours) down into three strengths but this layout looks good and we don't want to overwhelm you. In addition to these, you can read about <a href="https://github.com/Shepherd-Dog/Shepherd-Dog/blob/master/values.md">our core values</a> or some of <a href="/blog">our blog posts</a>.

            <img src="/media/focus.svg" />
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>
              We're a small, focused team. Our size allows us to avoid communication and project management overhead. Our diverse skillsets allow us to handle everything needed to build and maintain software from initial discovery to final testing.

            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>
              We are technology-agnostic, speak many languages, and have experience with a variety of frameworks. This allows us to choose the right thing for your project.

            <h3>Care</h3>
            <p>
              We have an unfair advantage &mdash; we care more than most. We pour ourselves entirely into a project and stop at nothing to deliver it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Delivering complicated projects is tough and we care enough to fight through the hard times.

          Testimonials

        <p>
          When working with clients we're behind the scenes to build things that reflect our client's branding and needs. Because of this we treat our clients and what we do for them with a level of secrecy &mdash; no one needs to know what they are building internally and what we're helping them with.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes marketing ourselves a little bit difficult because we can't just openly share what we've built with the world. Similarly, we've masked (and pixelated) the identities of our clients that provided testimonials here.
        </p>
        <ul class="testimonials">

              <p>
                This is a testimonial. This isn't the real testimonial because I can't find the real testimonial in my email. That is not a good testimonial for my skills at finding emails.
